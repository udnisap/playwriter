this is the playwriter codebase

the extension uses chrome.debugger to manage the user browser

read ./README.md for an overview of how this extension and mcp work
read skills/playwriter/SKILL.md to understand the MCP docs (source of truth)

## backward compatibility

breaking changes to the WS protocol MUST never be made. publishing the extension code will never be instant, which means the extension must keep working with newer versions of the MCP and WS relay server.

## architecture

- user installs the extension in chrome. we assume there is only one chrome window for now, the first opened. 
- extension connects to a websocket server on port 19988. if this server is not yet open, it retries connecting in a loop
- the MCP spawns the ws server if not already listening on 19988, in background. the mcp then connects to this same server with a playwright client
- the server exposes /cdp/client-id which is used by playwright clients to communicate with the extension
- the extension instead connects to /extension which is used to receive cdp commands and send responses and cdp events.
- some events are treated specially for example because
  - we need to send attachedToTarget to let playwright know which pages are available
  - we need to send detachedFromTarget when we disable the extension in a tab
  - a few more events need custom handling
- tabs are identified by sessionId or targetId (CDP concepts) or tabId (chrome debugger concept only)

mcp.ts MUST never use console.log. only console.error

write code that will run on all platforms: mac, linux, windows. especially around paths handling and command execution

## development

### running MCP locally

to test the MCP server with local changes, add it to your MCP client config with tsx:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwriter": {
      "command": "tsx",
      "args": ["/path/to/playwriter/playwriter/src/mcp.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

make sure you have tsx installed globally: `pnpm i -g tsx`

### running CLI locally

to test CLI changes without publishing:

```bash
cd playwriter
tsx src/cli.ts -e "await page.goto('https://example.com')"
tsx src/cli.ts -e "console.log(await accessibilitySnapshot({ page }))"
tsx src/cli.ts session new
tsx src/cli.ts -s 1 -e "await page.click('button')"
```

### reloading extension during development

after making changes to extension code:

```bash
cd extension
pnpm reload  # builds and opens chrome://extensions page
```

then click the reload button on the extension card in Chrome. the extension has a stable dev ID (`pebbngnfojnignonigcnkdilknapkgid`) so you don't need to reconfigure anything.

### testing

run `cd playwriter && pnpm test` to test the extension and mcp and CDP directly in a chrome instance automated. with the extension loaded too.

```bash
cd playwriter
pnpm test              # run all tests (takes ~90 seconds)
pnpm test -t "screenshot"  # run specific test by name
pnpm test:watch        # watch mode
```

the test script passes `-u` to update inline snapshots automatically.

#### test setup

tests use these utilities from `test-utils.ts`:

```ts
// setup browser with extension loaded + relay server
const testCtx = await setupTestContext({ 
  port: 19987, 
  tempDirPrefix: 'pw-test-',
  toggleExtension: true  // creates initial page with extension enabled
})

// get extension service worker to call extension functions
const serviceWorker = await getExtensionServiceWorker(testCtx.browserContext)

// toggle extension on current tab
await serviceWorker.evaluate(async () => {
  await globalThis.toggleExtensionForActiveTab()
})

// cleanup after tests
await cleanupTestContext(testCtx, cleanup)
```

to test MCP tools, create an MCP client:

```ts
import { createMCPClient } from './mcp-client.js'

const { client, cleanup } = await createMCPClient({ port: 19987 })
const result = await client.callTool({
  name: 'execute',
  arguments: { code: 'await page.goto("https://example.com")' }
})
```

#### adding tests

tests live in `playwriter/src/*.test.ts`. add new tests to existing describe blocks or create new test files.

each test should reset the extension connection. NEVER call `browser.close()` in tests.

remember: toggling extension on a tab adds it to available pages. if you toggle then call `context.newPage()`, you'll have 2 pages.

IMPORTANT: set bash timeout to at least 90000ms when running `pnpm test`

to debug test failures, inspect the relay server log file: `playwriter logfile` (e.g. `/tmp/playwriter/relay-server.log`). contains extension, MCP and WS server logs with all CDP events.

### project structure

extension/ contains the chrome extension code. you need to run `pnpm build` to make it ready to be loaded in chrome. the extension folder chrome will use is extension/dist

when I ask you to release extension run package.json release script

playwriter contains the ws server and MCP code. also the tests for the mcp are there. skills/playwriter/SKILL.md is the source of truth for MCP docs - edit that file to update agent instructions. the build script generates playwriter/src/prompt.md (gitignored) from SKILL.md, stripping CLI-only sections.

playwriter/src/resource.md is for more generic knowledge about playwright that the agent can use when necessary, for things like best practices for selecting locators on the page

website/public/resources/ and website/public/SKILL.md are auto-generated by `playwriter/scripts/build-resources.ts` during `pnpm build`. DO NOT edit these files manually - edit the source files instead (e.g. `debugger-examples.ts`, `editor-examples.ts`, `styles-examples.ts`, `skills/playwriter/SKILL.md`)

## CDP docs

here are some commands you can run to fetch docs about CDP domains (events and commands namespaces)

```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-protocol/master/pdl/domains/Target.pdl # manage “targets”: pages, iframes, workers, etc., and attach/detach sessions
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-protocol/master/pdl/domains/Browser.pdl # top-level browser control: version info, window management, permission settings, etc.
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-protocol/master/pdl/domains/Page.pdl # navigate, reload, screenshot, PDF, frame management, dialogs, and page lifecycle events.
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-protocol/master/pdl/domains/Emulation.pdl # emulate device metrics, viewport, timezone, locale, geolocation, media type, CPU, etc.
```

you can list other files in that folder on github to read more if you need to control things like DOM, performance, etc

## changelogs

when you do an important change, update relevant CHANGELOG.md files for each package.

also bump package.json versions and IMPORTANT also the extension/manifest.json version too

## debugging playwriter mcp issues

sometimes the user will ask you to debug an mcp issue. to do this you may want to add logs to the mcp and server. to do this you will also need to restart the server so we use the latest code. restarting the mcp yourself is not possible. instead you will need to ask the user to do it or write a test case, where the mcp can be reloaded. also making changes in the extension will not work. you will have to write a test case for that to work. you can ask the user to reconnect these too. for reloading the extension you can run the `pnpm build` script and do `osascript -e 'tell application "Google Chrome" to open location "chrome://extensions/?id=pebbngnfojnignonigcnkdilknapkgid"'` to make it easier for the user to reload it

if the problem was in the ws server you can restart that yourself killing process listening on 19988 and sending a new mcp call.


## playwright source code

the playwright source code is cloned at `./tmp/playwright` (gitignored). use Task agents to explore it when you need to understand how playwright implements CDP commands, page discovery, browser connection, etc. key files:

- `packages/playwright-core/src/server/chromium/` - chromium-specific CDP implementation
- `packages/playwright-core/src/server/chromium/crConnection.ts` - CDP websocket connection
- `packages/playwright-core/src/server/chromium/crBrowser.ts` - browser and page discovery
- `packages/playwright-core/src/server/chromium/chromium.ts` - connectOverCDP implementation

## ./claude-extension

ignore ./claude-extension. this is the source code of the Claude Chrome extension. used to reverse engineer new methods and tools to extract and control the page
