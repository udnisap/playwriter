# Changelog

## 0.0.69

### Features

- **First extension keeps connection**: When multiple Playwriter extensions are installed, the actively-used one (with tabs) now keeps the connection. New extensions are rejected with code 4002 instead of taking over.
- **Smarter reconnection**: Extension now polls `/extension/status` for `activeTargets` count and only attempts reconnection when the other extension has no active tabs.

### Bug Fixes

- **Proper state handling for 4002 rejection**: Fixed issue where extension would keep retrying forever when rejected during WebSocket handshake. Now correctly enters `extension-replaced` polling state.

## 0.0.68

### Bug Fixes

- **Improved connection reliability**: Use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` to avoid DNS/IPv6 resolution issues
- **Global connection timeout**: Added 15-second global timeout wrapper around `connect()` to prevent hanging forever when individual timeouts fail
- **Better WebSocket handling**: Added `settled` flag to properly handle timeout/open/error/close race conditions

### Changes

- **Faster retry loop**: Reduced retry attempts from 30 to 5 since `maintainLoop` retries every 3 seconds anyway
- **Allow own extension pages**: Added `OUR_EXTENSION_IDS` to allow attaching to our own extension pages while blocking other extensions
